Expired deprecation of multidimensional indexing with non-tuple values
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Multidimensional indexing with anything but a tuple was
deprecated in NumPy 1.15.

Previously, code such as ``arr[ind]`` where ``ind = [[0, 1], [0, 1]]``
produced a ``FutureWarning`` and was interpreted as a multidimensional
index (i.e., ``arr[tuple(ind)]``). Now this example is treated like an
array index over a single dimension (``arr[array(ind)]``).
