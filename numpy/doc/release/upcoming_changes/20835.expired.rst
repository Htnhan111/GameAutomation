Exceptions will be raised during array-like creation
----------------------------------------------------

When an object raised an exception during access of the special
attributes ``__array__`` or ``__array_interface__``, this exception
was usually ignored.
This behaviour was deprecated in 1.21, and the exception will now be raised.
