Math C library feature detection now uses correct signatures
------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling is preceded by a detection phase to determine whether the
underlying libc supports certain math operations. Previously this code
did not respect the proper signatures. Fixing this enables compilation
for the ``wasm-ld`` backend (compilation for web assembly) and reduces
the number of warnings.
