Deprecation of ``numpy.distutils``
----------------------------------

``numpy.distutils`` has been deprecated, as a result of ``distutils``
itself being deprecated. It will not be present in NumPy for Python >= 3.12,
and will be removed completely 2 years after the release of Python 3.12

For more details, see :ref:`distutils-status-migration`.
