``np.loadtxt`` now supports quote character and single converter function
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
`numpy.loadtxt` now supports an additional ``quotechar`` keyword argument
which is not set by default.  Using ``quotechar='"'`` will read quoted fields
as used by the Excel CSV dialect.

Further, it is now possible to pass a single callable rather than a dictionary
for the ``converters`` argument.
