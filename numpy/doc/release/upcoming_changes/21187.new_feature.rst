deterministic output files for F2PY
-----------------------------------
For F77 inputs, ``f2py`` will generate ``modname-f2pywrappers.f``
unconditionally, though these may be empty.  For free-form inputs,
``modname-f2pywrappers.f``, ``modname-f2pywrappers2.f90`` will both be generated
unconditionally, and may be empty. This allows writing generic output rules in
``cmake`` or ``meson`` and other build systems. Older behavior can be restored
by passing ``--skip-empty-wrappers`` to ``f2py``. :ref:`f2py-meson` details usage.
