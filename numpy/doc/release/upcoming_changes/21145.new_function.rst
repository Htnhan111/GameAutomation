NumPy now supports the DLPack protocol
--------------------------------------
`numpy.from_dlpack` has been added to NumPy to exchange data using the DLPack protocol.
It accepts Python objects that implement the ``__dlpack__`` and ``__dlpack_device__``
methods and returns a ndarray object which is generally the view of the data of the input
object.
